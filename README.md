# Build

- Fetch all submodules
- Open the project in a SLN-compatiable IDE. On Windows, use Visual Studio or SharpDevelop. On OS X or Linux, use MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio.
- Assembly signing is enabled by default, so in order to build, you must create a file called `PluginCore2SNK.snk` in the Aluminum.PluginCore2 subdirectory, or you can disable signing in ALL projects.
- Build  the project normally.
